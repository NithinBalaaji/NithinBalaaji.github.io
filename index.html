                                Ritesh was born to a business family in Orissa and attended the Sacred Heart School in Raygada, Orissa. During the growing up days in Raygada, it was all about fun and learning for him. But Ritesh’s ways were rather unconventional from those of other kids. His fun elements included screwing around with the computer, trying hard to find opportunities to make mistakes so that he could learn new stuff. As a result, he gained a keen interest in softwares. This started with the idea of knowing more about it and then the hunger just went on increasing. To quench his thirst to know more, he borrowed his elder brother’s books for programming. Some of the fun languages like Basic and Pascal were taught in school itself, and rest he managed to learn from Google. He had started coding when he was just eight years old. Hence, software had obviously become his first love. By the time he reached tenth grade, he had made up his mind and wanted to take up coding for eleventh.

                                Later in 2011, Ritesh moved to Delhi with strong intentions of starting up something of his own. At the same time, he also prepared for SAT to move to the States for further studies. But fortunately or unfortunately, SAT never happened. Thereafter he used to do nothing but read about entrepreneurs, startups, businesses and especially, Airbnb.

                                Brought up in the small town called Harduaganj near Aligarh, Vijay Shekhar Sharma taught himself to read two books at a time -- on in hindi and the other in English -- this helped him prepare for his dream to become an engineer. Sharma finished plus two at the age of 14 way ahead of the level but had to wait for year to get into an engineering college because of his age.                                <br>
                                Since Sharma had done most of his schooling in Hindi, an English entrance exam would have been an ask but he took up the challenge. His technique to read two books at a time helped him crack the entrance for Delhi College of Engineering in 1994.
                                The advent of Yahoo, Netscape altered the jobs landscape in India. Stories from Silicon Valley of people who dropped out to create firms became inspirational. Sharma teamed up with a friend to start his first company -- XS Corps -- while still in college. The firm built content management systems for the web with his college hostel room for office and a shopkeeper's phone as office landline.
                           <br>
                            In 2005, he had raised a hefty amount of Rs 8 lakh through his venture of which he was conned off 40%. He was devastated. But Sharma was not a man to give up so easily. Things took to a better turn when he began One97, the parent company of Paytm. He started experimenting with the three basics of internet- content, advertising and commerce. But the big eureka moment came in 2011 when he first pitched the idea of entering the payment ecosystem in front of his board.
                            He put 1% of his equity, which was about $2 million around 2011, on the table and said, “This is for all of you, if I waste the money that we put on the site.” He adds, “There is no fun in doing what others ask you to do, the real fun is in doing what people say you can’t do.”

                                Meet Trishneet Arora, a veritable wizard of technology who is an author, a cyber-security expert, an ethical hacker, an entrepreneur and an avid speaker on security solutions. Just at the age of 21, Trishneet has been able to accomplish a whole lot.

                                With no family background in computers or business, Trishneet’s journey from a middle class child to a successful young adult is very extraordinary and inspirational.

                                The tale began a decade ago when 11 year old Trishneet got his first computer. Soon he started to experiment with it and in turn learned all about computer hardware. As a result of his computer fanaticism he failed in the class VIII examination and completed his class X through open learning.

        <h1><u>Ambition</u></h1>
        In the short term, I expect to pass out from this college with wonderful memories. I wish to get placed in a start up based company to understand the ins and outs of the market to have a better
        understanding. In long term, I wish to start a business/company of my own which will create a positive impact. I have already started to think some business plans which would help me in the same.
        I truly believe we are much more worth than we can imagine. We believe that the price tags set by companies is equivalent to our worth. But indeed we are worth the amount of business, the comapnies
        are able to make out of us.
